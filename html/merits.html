			<h2 style = "color: white">Overview</h2>
			<p>The Center for Environmental Forensic Science (CEFS) is a unique alliance among scientists, likeminded government investigators, non-government organizations and private sector associates, aiming to develop data-driven models and push science forward to combat transnational environmental crime. </p> 
			<p>Transnational environmental crime, and specifically illegal trade in wildlife, timber, and fish products, is rapidly increasing, endangering species, damaging ecosystems, promoting corruption and violence, and undermining public health and national security. Growth is coincident with marine shipping and free trade agreements; traffickers conceal their contraband in the burgeoning legal trade. Current forensic approaches to this problem are inadequate. Much contraband goes undetected due to pressures to keep trade flowing. Seizures of contraband are often inadequately analyzed; information from multiple seizures is not integrated to form a picture of the responsible criminal organization.</p> 
			<p>As a result, most prosecutions and convictions target minor players, while the organizational leadership remains intact. Responses to transnational crime are often limited to national or lesser scope. This fragmented approach cripples investigations, since related shipments are commonly seized in different countries.</p> 
			<p>Our approach involves holistic information exchange on case evidence and forensic science to foster collaboration and education across geographic borders to get ahead of transnational criminal organizations.</p>

			<h3 style = "color: white">Broader Impacts</h3>
			<p>In advancing the basic science relevant to this work, we will protect vulnerable species, ecosystems, and emerging economies by supporting effective investigation, prosecution and prevention of environmental crime. We will strengthen international collaborations and expand capacity in source and transit countries by placing new training, monitoring and communication techniques into the hands of local authorities and organizations. Monitoring of pathogens in wildlife contraband will aid in detection of future threats to human and ecosystem health. In the US, courses, workshops and internships will prepare future forensic scientists for effective teamwork with epidemiologists, managers, educators, and legal experts.</p>
