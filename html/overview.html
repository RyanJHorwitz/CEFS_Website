			<p>The Center for Environmental Forensic Science (CEFS) is a unique alliance among scientists, likeminded government investigators, non-government organizations and private sector associates, aiming to develop data-driven models and push science forward to combat transnational environmental crime. </p> 
			<p>Transnational environmental crime, and specifically illegal trade in wildlife, timber, and fish products, is rapidly increasing, endangering species, damaging ecosystems, promoting corruption and violence, and undermining public health and national security. Growth is coincident with marine shipping and free trade agreements; traffickers conceal their contraband in the burgeoning legal trade. Current forensic approaches to this problem are inadequate. Much contraband goes undetected due to pressures to keep trade flowing. Seizures of contraband are often inadequately analyzed; information from multiple seizures is not integrated to form a picture of the responsible criminal organization.</p> 
			<p>As a result, most prosecutions and convictions target minor players, while the organizational leadership remains intact. Responses to transnational crime are often limited to national or lesser scope. This fragmented approach cripples investigations, since related shipments are commonly seized in different countries.</p> 
			<p>Our approach involves holistic information exchange on case evidence and forensic science to foster collaboration and education across geographic borders to get ahead of transnational criminal organizations.</p>

		<div id = "methods">
			<h3 style = "color: white">Merit and  Focus</h3>
			<p>We advance forensic, complex system science, and legal and policy innovations, developing and deploying novel strategies and tools throughout the forensic process:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li> Rapid detection methods to identify potential contraband and establish probable cause for seizure, including remote air sampling to search shipping containers, and use of photo recognition and handheld DNA analysis devices to detect listed species. </li>
				<li>Combining genetic, chemical, isotope, pollen, and pathogen data with physical evidence (documents, cell phone logs) to determine the origins, dates, and compositions of contraband and detect links between seized shipments.</li>
				<li>Synthesis of diverse information, bolstered by strong data, collaboration, and communication, to build pictures of the responsible criminal organizations, make investigations more proactive, and support integrated cases admissible in courts of law.</li> 
			</ol>
			
			<p>Initial work will focus on four areas:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Wildlife trafficking in Africa, where a limited number of large criminal organizations traffic in ivory, pangolin scales, and rhino horn. </li>
					<li>Global illegal logging and trade of timber, leading to deforestation and destruction of indigenous communities, and promoting governmental corruption. </li>
					<li>Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, which drive both environmental damage and human trafficking. </li>
					<li>(4) Monitoring of pathogens in illicit wildlife and timber products, important both in tracing the origin of shipments and in managing the grave risk of disease transmission to humans, animals, and plants. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The techniques developed, however, will be broadly useful against diverse forms of environmental crime and illicit trade networks. Leveraging collaboration across disciplines brings multiple techniques to bear on stopping environmental crime: physical and biological sciences to detect and analyze contraband; social and data sciences to build predictive models of criminal activities; criminology and law to manage investigations in a legally sound manner.</p>
		</div>
		<div id = "impacts">
			<h3 style = "color: white">Broader Impacts</h3>
			<p>In advancing the basic science relevant to this work, we will protect vulnerable species, ecosystems, and emerging economies by supporting effective investigation, prosecution and prevention of environmental crime. We will strengthen international collaborations and expand capacity in source and transit countries by placing new training, monitoring and communication techniques into the hands of local authorities and organizations. Monitoring of pathogens in wildlife contraband will aid in detection of future threats to human and ecosystem health. In the US, courses, workshops and internships will prepare future forensic scientists for effective teamwork with epidemiologists, managers, educators, and legal experts.</p>
